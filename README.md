# Cat-vs.-Cat-Loaf
# This project investigates the classification of images
into two distinct categories: ”Cat” and ”Cat Loaf,” using Con-
volutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project is inspired by
the nuanced challenge of recognizing animal postures, specifically
differentiating traditional cat poses from loaf-like compact posi-
tions. The dataset contains 646 RGB images, evenly split between
the two classes. Images were preprocessed through resizing,
normalization, and data augmentation to enhance generalization.
The CNN architecture employed consists of convolutional, max-
pooling, and dense layers, achieving a validation accuracy of
approximately 66%. This project highlights the potential of CNNs
in solving posture-based classification tasks, emphasizing the
importance of feature extraction and augmentation in improving
model performance. The study also discusses challenges such
as subtle posture variations and dataset limitations, proposing
future improvements to address these issues.
